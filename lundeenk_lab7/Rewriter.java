/**
 * Does the rewriting in an L-system grammar. The idea here is that you start 
 * out with an axiom which is just a string. Then you apply rewrite rules, 
 * called productions, to expand some or all of the letters in the axiom to 
 * create a string, called a derived word. You can rewrite the word again 
 * using the same productions to get further generations of words in the 
 * grammar. Here's an example:
 * <ul>
 * <li>axiom  : A
 * <li>rules  : (A → AB), (B → A)
 * </ul>
 * which produces: 
 * <p>AB as the first derived word (n=1) since A is replaced by AB
 * <p>For n=2 we take the AB from generation 1 and apply the production 
 * rules again to get ABA since the A changes to AB and the B changes to A.
 * <p>For n=3, we use the rules to move from ABA to ABAAB.
 * <p>Then for n=4, it becomes ABAABABA.
 * <p>It continues on in this way for as many generations as you like.
 * 
 * This Rewriter though is specific to the RenderCommands that we have
 * defined and it uses our RenderQueue to provide the rules and for the seed
 * and rewrite results.
